Installation

## [​](https://docs.cursor.com/get-started/installation\#installation)  Installation

The installer for your operating system will automatically download

2. Run the installer and wait for installation to complete
3. Launch Cursor via the Desktop shortcut or from the Applications menu

## [​](https://docs.cursor.com/get-started/installation\#setting-up)  Setting up

On your first launch, you’ll be prompted to configure a few settings to ensure you get up and running quickly!

## Keyboard shortcuts

If you are coming from a different editor, you can choose the default shortcuts you want to start with, so they are as familiar as possible.

## Language

If you want the AI to talk to you in a different language, you can enter the name of the language you want to use. This can be configured further in the [rules](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules)

## Codebase Indexing

Cursor indexes your codebase locally to provide better AI suggestions. Learn more in [Codebase Indexing](https://docs.cursor.com/context/codebase-indexing).

## CLI Shortcuts

You can choose to install `cursor` and `code` commands to launch Cursor from the terminal.

After configuring these settings, you will have the option to import your VS Code settings in one click. If you accept, this will import your extensions, themes, user settings, and keyboard shortcuts into Cursor, so you can get started right away.

Next, you’ll be asked about your data preference. To learn more about this, and make an informed decision, read more about our dedicated [privacy page](https://docs.cursor.com/account/privacy)

## [​](https://docs.cursor.com/get-started/installation\#migrating-from-other-editors)  Migrating from other editors

While Cursor is built on top the same core as VS Code, there are some key differences that you should be aware of. Additionally, for those coming from other editors, you may not be familiar with the structure of Cursor.

To help you get started, we’ve put together a guide to help you migrate from other editors.

[**Migrating from VSCode**](https://docs.cursor.com/guides/migration/vscode) [**Migrating from JetBrains**](https://docs.cursor.com/guides/migration/jetbrains)

We hope to add more migration guides for other editors soon!
