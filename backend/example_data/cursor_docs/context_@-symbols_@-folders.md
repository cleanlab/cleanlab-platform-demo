@Folders

You can reference entire folders in Cursor as context. When using `@Folders` with Agent, it attaches a list of all items in the directory, which allows the Agent to search through the contents itself. This gives Agent the ability to explore and analyze the folderâ€™s contents independently as needed for the task at hand.
