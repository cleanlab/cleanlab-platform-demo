## [​](https://docs.cursor.com/get-started/welcome\#where-did-cursor-come-from%3F)  Where did Cursor come from?

Code is fundamentally text, and our tools for writing it have evolved from simple text editors into increasingly intelligent development environments.

Initially, we had features like syntax highlighting, to make code more readable. Then, we had features like autocomplete, to make code more efficient.

These have been the standard for a long time, but with Cursor, we’re re-inventing how you work with code.

## [​](https://docs.cursor.com/get-started/welcome\#how-does-it-work%3F)  How does it work?

Cursor provides the user with a few fundamental features that are only made possible by the development of LLMs (Large Language Models).

## [​](https://docs.cursor.com/get-started/welcome\#how-do-i-get-started%3F)  How do I get started?

You can download Cursor from the [Cursor website](https://www.cursor.com/) for your platform of choice. Being based on VS Code, it’s extremely easy to get started, and all the AI features are opt-in.

You can also have Cursor import all your VS Code extensions and settings in one-click. To help you try Cursor, we have a 14-day free trial our of Pro plan, with no credit card required!
