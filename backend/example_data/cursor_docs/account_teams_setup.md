## [​](https://docs.cursor.com/account/teams/setup\#cursor-for-business)  Cursor for Business

Cursor was built with versatility in mind, and can be used from hobby projects to large scale enterprise applications. For the best experience, we have built a Business plan that enhances the Cursor application for teams!

Alongside the Cursor application, we have built a suite of tools to help you manage your team, including SSO, team management, and more.

## [​](https://docs.cursor.com/account/teams/setup\#creating-a-team)  Creating a Team

To get started with Cursor for your team, you can create a team by following the steps below.

1

Set up Business plan

To create a team, you need to be on the [Business plan](https://docs.cursor.com/account/plans-and-usage). To get started, you can choose one of the following options:

[**New Account** \\
\\
If you are new to Cursor, click here to create a new account and team](https://cursor.com/team/new-team) [**Existing Subscription** \\
\\
If you are already on a Pro plan, you can click the “Upgrade to Business” button in dashboard](https://docs.cursor.com/account/dashboard)

2

Enter team details

After clicking “New Team”, enter the details for the team. You will have to
select name and billing cycle for the team

3

Invite members

After the team is created, you can start inviting members to the team. All
changes to users are prorated, meaning that we will only charge for the time
that a user has been a member of the team

4

Enable SSO (optional)

After the team is created, you can enable [SSO](https://docs.cursor.com/account/teams/sso) for the team for additional security and easy onboarding for new members of your team.

### [​](https://docs.cursor.com/account/teams/setup\#my-team-uses-zscalar-%2F-a-proxy-%2F-a-vpn%2C-will-cursor-work-properly%3F)  My team uses ZScalar / a proxy / a VPN, will Cursor work properly?

Cursor uses HTTP/2 to provide the best experience, and unfortunately some proxies and VPNs block this.

To resolve this, you can enable the HTTP/1.1 fallback in the app settings. This will force Cursor to use HTTP/1.1, which is not blocked by most proxies and VPNs.

We hope to add automatic detection and fallback in the future!

### [​](https://docs.cursor.com/account/teams/setup\#how-can-i-purchase-licenses-for-my-company%3F)  How can I purchase licenses for my company?

Cursor is billed on a per-user basis, and does not have a fixed amount of seats. You can invite as many or as few users as you’d like to your team, and you will only be charged for the amount of users in your team.

If you add or remove users from your team, the billing will be updated immediately, and you will either be charged or refunded accordingly. Refunds are done as account credit, so will be automatically applied to your next invoice.

For simplicity, we keep your renewal date on the same day each month/year, and any mid-plan changes are prorated.

### [​](https://docs.cursor.com/account/teams/setup\#how-can-i-set-up-a-team-when-i%E2%80%99m-not-going-to-use-cursor-myself%3F)  How can I set up a team when I’m not going to use Cursor myself?

As part of our business management tools, you can now set members of your team to be [Unpaid Admins](https://docs.cursor.com/account/teams/members).

This allows members of your team to administrate the team and it’s billing, without being charged for a Cursor license themselves.

Business plan teams always require at least one paid member. However, invoices for team changes are not billed immediately, so you can set up a team, invite a member and change your own role without being charged.
