## [​](https://docs.cursor.com/account/teams/members\#roles)  Roles

### [​](https://docs.cursor.com/account/teams/members\#member)  Member

Members are the default role for team members with access to Cursor’s Pro features.

## Pro Features

Full access to all **Pro features** including 500 premium requests and unlimited completions

## Paid Seat

Each member uses **one billable seat** and counts towards the total renewal of your team each month / year

Members have **no access** to the billing settings or the admin dashboard.

### [​](https://docs.cursor.com/account/teams/members\#admins)  Admins

Admins have comprehensive control over team management and security settings to ensure smooth team operations.

## Pro Features

Full access to all **Pro features** as normal members

## Team Management

Add and remove members, modify roles, and setup SSO

## Usage Controls

Configure usage-based pricing and set spending limits for the team

### [​](https://docs.cursor.com/account/teams/members\#unpaid-admin)  Unpaid Admin

Unpaid Admins manage the team without using a paid seat - ideal for IT or finance staff, who don’t need Cursor access.

## No Paid Seat

Unpaid Admins are **not billable**, and do not have any Pro features

## Team Management

Add and remove members, modify roles, and setup SSO

## Usage Controls

Configure usage-based pricing and set spending limits for the team

Unpaid Admins are required to have at least one paid Admin on the team.

## [​](https://docs.cursor.com/account/teams/members\#managing-members)  Managing members

All members in the team can invite other members. We currently do not have any way to control invites.

### [​](https://docs.cursor.com/account/teams/members\#add-member)  Add member

Members can be added in three ways:

## Email invitation

\- Click the `Invite Members` button

\- Enter email addresses

\- Users will receive an email invite to join the team

## Invite link

\- Click the `Invite Members` button

\- Copy the `Invite Link`

\- Share with team members

## SSO

\- Configure SSO in the [admin dashboard](https://docs.cursor.com/account/teams/sso)

\- Users will be automatically added to the team when they login via their SSO-enabled email address

Invite links do not expire and anyone who gets access to the link can join a
team.

You can prevent this by setting up [SSO](https://docs.cursor.com/account/teams/sso)

### [​](https://docs.cursor.com/account/teams/members\#remove-member)  Remove member

Admins can remove members at any time by clicking the context menu and then “Remove”. We’ll only charge for time the member was in the team, and any pro-rated credit earned from removing a member mid-plan will be applied to your next invoice.

### [​](https://docs.cursor.com/account/teams/members\#change-role)  Change role

Admins can change roles for other members by clicking the context menu and then use the “Change role” option.

There must be at least one Admin, and one paid member on the team at all times.

## [​](https://docs.cursor.com/account/teams/members\#security-%26-sso)  Security & SSO

SAML 2.0 Single Sign-On (SSO) is available on Business and Enterprise plans. Key features:

- Configure SSO connections ( [learn more about SSO setup](https://docs.cursor.com/account/teams/sso))
- Set up domain verification
- Automatic user enrollment through SSO

## [​](https://docs.cursor.com/account/teams/members\#billing)  Billing

When adding new team members:

- Each new member or admin adds a billable seat (see [pricing](https://cursor.com/pricing))
- Seat changes are prorated for your billing period
- Unpaid admin seats are not counted

When adding new team members in the middle of a month, we’ll only charge you for the days they actually use. Similarly, if someone leaves the team, we’ll credit your account for any unused days.

If you change someone’s role (e.g from Admin to Unpaid Admin), we’ll automatically adjust the billing from the day of the change. You can choose to be billed either monthly or yearly - both options are available to suit your needs.

Your monthly or yearly renewal will always occur on the same day as when you first signed up, regardless of additional or removed members.

### [​](https://docs.cursor.com/account/teams/members\#switch-to-yearly-billing)  Switch to Yearly billing

You can save **20%** of the Business plan by switching from monthly to yearly billing. This can be done from the [dashboard](https://docs.cursor.com/account/dashboard)

1. Go to [settings](https://cursor.com/settings)
2. In the account section, click on “Advanced” then “Upgrade to yearly billing”

![](https://mintlify.s3.us-west-1.amazonaws.com/cursor/images/plans/business/upgrade-to-yearly.png)

Please note that you can only switch from monthly to yearly billing via the dashboard. To switch from yearly to monthly billing, please contact us at [hi@cursor.com](mailto:hi@cursor.com).
