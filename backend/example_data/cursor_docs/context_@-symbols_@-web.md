With `@Web`, Cursor constructs a search query based on the query and the context you’ve provided, and searches the web to
find relevant information as additional context.

This can be useful to allow Cursor to find the most up-to-date information online, or to allow Cursor to scrape multiple websites in a few seconds to find the best answer, without the user having to manually search anywhere.

When using Agent mode, Cursor will automatically search the web when it needs up-to-date information or additional context.
