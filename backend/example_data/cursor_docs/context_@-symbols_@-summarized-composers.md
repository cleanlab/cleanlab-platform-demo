@Summarized Composers

When working on complex tasks in [Composer](https://docs.cursor.com/chat/agent), you might want to reference context or decisions from previous conversations. The `@Summarized Composers` symbol allows you to include summarized versions of your previous Composer sessions as context.

This is particularly useful when:

- You have a long Composer session with important context you want to reference
- Youâ€™re starting a new but related task and want to maintain continuity
- You want to share the reasoning or decisions from a previous session
