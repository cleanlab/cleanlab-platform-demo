Terminal Cmd K

In the built-in Cursor terminal, you can press `Ctrl/⌘ K` to open a prompt bar on the bottom of the terminal.
This prompt bar allows you to describe your desired action in the terminal, and terminal Cmd K will generate a command.
You can accept the command by hitting `esc` or run the command immediately with `Ctrl/⌘ + Enter`.

By default, Terminal Cmd K sees your recent terminal history, your instructions, and anything else you put in the prompt bar as context.
