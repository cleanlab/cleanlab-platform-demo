@Git

Currently, `@Git` is only supported in Chat & Composer

In Cursor’s Chat, you can use `@Git` to add git commits, diffs, or pull requests to your prompt.

## [​](https://docs.cursor.com/context/@-symbols/@-git\#common-use-cases)  Common Use Cases

One common use case for `@Git` is to allow Cursor’s AI to scan the diff and look for bugs or issues that could be caused by the diff.

You could also use `@Diff of Working State` to generate a commit message from your current diffs.
