@Files

In AI input boxes such as in Chat and Cmd K, you can reference entire files by using `@Files`.
Also, if you continue to type after `@`, you will see your file search results after the [`@Code`](https://docs.cursor.com/context/@-symbols/@-code) strategy.

In order to make sure the file you’re referencing is the correct file, Cursor will show a preview of the file’s path. This is especially useful when you have multiple files with the same name in different folders.

### [​](https://docs.cursor.com/context/@-symbols/@-files\#chat-long-file-references)  Chat Long File References

In Cursor’s Chat, if the contents of a file is too long, Cursor will chunk the file into smaller chunks and rerank them based on relevance to the query.

### [​](https://docs.cursor.com/context/@-symbols/@-files\#drag-and-drop)  Drag and Drop

You can drag and drop files from the primary sidebar into Composer, Chat or Cmd K to add them as context.
