Introduction

## [​](https://docs.cursor.com/get-started/introduction\#overview)  Overview

Cursor is a powerful AI-first code editor that enhances your development workflow. After [installation](https://docs.cursor.com/get-started/installation), you’ll have access to these core features that work together seamlessly to make you more productive:

- **AI-powered code completion** that understands your codebase and provides context-aware suggestions
- **Conversation interface** for exploring, understanding, and modifying code with Ask, Edit, and Agent modes
- **Intelligent tools** for handling complex development tasks

## [​](https://docs.cursor.com/get-started/introduction\#getting-started)  Getting Started

Start exploring Cursor’s AI-powered features:

- **Tab**: Press `Tab` for intelligent code completions
- **CMD-K**: Use `Cmd/Ctrl + K` for inline code edits
- **Chat**: Use `⌘I` to open the unified AI interface with Ask, Edit, and Agent modes

## [​](https://docs.cursor.com/get-started/introduction\#settings)  Settings

Cursor is designed to be flexible and customizable. You can configure it in two ways:

### [​](https://docs.cursor.com/get-started/introduction\#cursor-settings)  Cursor Settings

- Access via gear icon, `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + J`, or Command Palette > `Cursor Settings`
- Configure AI features and Cursor-specific preferences

### [​](https://docs.cursor.com/get-started/introduction\#editor-settings)  Editor Settings

- Access via Command Palette ( `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P`) \> `"Preferences: Open Settings (UI)"`
- Adjust editor behavior and appearance

Let’s explore each feature in detail:

### [​](https://docs.cursor.com/get-started/introduction\#tab)  Tab

Tab completion in Cursor is powered by advanced AI models that understand your code context. As you type, you’ll receive intelligent suggestions that:

- Complete your current line of code
- Suggest entire function implementations
- Help with common patterns and boilerplate
- Adapt to your coding style over time

Learn more about [Tab features](https://docs.cursor.com/tab/overview) or see how it [compares to GitHub Copilot](https://docs.cursor.com/tab/from-gh-copilot).

### [​](https://docs.cursor.com/get-started/introduction\#chat)  Chat

Cursor provides a unified AI interface with three modes that seamlessly work together:

**Agent Mode (Default)**

- Make codebase-wide changes and refactoring
- Implement new features from requirements
- Debug complex issues across multiple files
- Generate tests and documentation
- Maintain consistency across your entire project

**Ask Mode**

- Ask questions about specific code sections
- Get explanations of complex functions
- Find code patterns and examples
- Discover and understand your codebase

**Custom modes**

- Create your own modes that fits your workflow

Switch between modes during conversations to best suit your current task. Learn more about the [unified AI interface](https://docs.cursor.com/chat/overview) or explore specific capabilities in [Agent mode](https://docs.cursor.com/chat/overview).

### [​](https://docs.cursor.com/get-started/introduction\#context)  Context

Context is the foundation that powers all of Cursor’s AI features. Here’s how it works:

- When you open a codebase, we automatically [index your code](https://docs.cursor.com/context/codebase-indexing) to make it available as context
- Use [@-symbols](https://docs.cursor.com/context/@-symbols/overview) to precisely control what context you provide:

  - [@files](https://docs.cursor.com/context/@-symbols/@-files) and [@folders](https://docs.cursor.com/context/@-symbols/@-folders) for specific paths
  - [@web](https://docs.cursor.com/context/@-symbols/@-web) for external documentation
  - [@git](https://docs.cursor.com/context/@-symbols/@-git) for version control context
- Configure [rules](https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules) to customize behavior
- Set up [MCP](https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol) for external context providers

## [​](https://docs.cursor.com/get-started/introduction\#models)  Models

You can see all the models we support and their pricing on the [models page](https://docs.cursor.com/settings/models). Configure your [API keys](https://docs.cursor.com/settings/api-keys) and [preferences](https://docs.cursor.com/settings/preferences) in Settings.

## [​](https://docs.cursor.com/get-started/introduction\#usage)  Usage

It’s highly recommended to read about [usage](https://docs.cursor.com/account/plans-and-usage) and [plans](https://docs.cursor.com/account/plans-and-usage) to understand how Cursor pricing works. Check out our [pricing page](https://docs.cursor.com/account/pricing) for more details about plans and features.
