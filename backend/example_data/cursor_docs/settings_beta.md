Early Access Program

Cursor offers an early access program that gives you early access to new and experimental features. While these features can be exciting, they may be less stable than our standard features.

Beta features are experimental and may contain bugs or unexpected behavior. We recommend staying on standard settings if you need a stable development environment.

If you decide you no longer want to be part of the early access program, you can opt out by toggling the ‘Update frequency’ dropdown to ‘Standard’ in the settings menu.

Then, either wait for the next update to take effect, or redownload Cursor’s latest stable release from [cursor.com](https://cursor.com/).
