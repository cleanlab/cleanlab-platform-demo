Getting a Request ID

When the Cursor team are investigating a technical issue, sometimes, we may ask you to provide us with a “request ID”.

## [​](https://docs.cursor.com/troubleshooting/request-reporting\#what-is-a-request-id%3F)  What is a request ID?

A request ID is a unique identifier that is generated when you submit a request to Cursor. It is a string of characters that is used to identify the request in our internal systems.

It usually follows a randomized format, such as: `8f2a5b91-4d3e-47c6-9f12-5e8d94ca7d23`.

## [​](https://docs.cursor.com/troubleshooting/request-reporting\#how-do-i-find-a-request-id%3F)  How do I find a request ID?

Request IDs are highly limited when Privacy Mode is enabled, so we recommend disabling Privacy Mode when reporting an issue.

As a reminder, users on a business plan have Privacy Mode enabled by default, by their organization’s admin.

### [​](https://docs.cursor.com/troubleshooting/request-reporting\#getting-your-current-request-id)  Getting your current request ID

If you are wanting to report an issue with your current or very recent conversation, you can do this in just a few clicks.

With the relevant conversation open in the Chat sidebar, you can use the context menu in the top right to see a few options - one of these options is the `Copy Request ID` option.

After copying the request ID, you can send it back to us to look into, either via the forum, or by email if requested by our support team.

### [​](https://docs.cursor.com/troubleshooting/request-reporting\#getting-a-request-id-from-a-previous-action)  Getting a request ID from a previous action

You can retrieve a historical request ID from within Cursor by running the `Report AI Action` command.

You you can do this by:

1. Opening the command palette `⌘⇧P`
2. Typing `Report AI Action`
3. Selecting the `Report AI Action` option

This will open a new popup, listing your most recent AI actions across Chat, CMD+K and Apply.

Select the action you want to report, by matching the time and feature the action was used in. Once you select the action, you have the option to copy the request ID to your clipboard. With it copied, you can send it back to us to look into!
