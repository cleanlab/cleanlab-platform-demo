Cursor comes with a set of third party docs crawled, indexed, and ready to be used as context. You can access them by using the `@Docs` symbol. You can find a list of our default pre-scraped docs [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/getcursor/crawler/main/docs.jsonl).

## [​](https://docs.cursor.com/context/@-symbols/@-docs\#add-custom-docs)  Add Custom Docs

If you want to crawl and index custom docs that are not already provided, you can do so by `@Docs` \> `Add new doc`.
The following modal will appear after you’ve pasted in the URL of your desired doc:

Cursor will then index and learn the doc, and you will be able to use it as context like any other doc. Make sure to add a trailing slash to the URL if you want to index all subpages and subdirectories

Cursor will automatically keep Docs indexed and will re-index them periodically to keep them up to date as they are edited or changed.

## [​](https://docs.cursor.com/context/@-symbols/@-docs\#manage-custom-docs)  Manage Custom Docs

Under `Cursor Settings` \> `Features` \> `Docs`, you will see the docs you have added.
You can edit, delete, or add new docs here.
